🩺 Kidney Cyst Detection AIA robust Deep Learning solution for automating the detection of kidney cysts in medical imaging, achieving 100% accuracy on external validation data.**📖 OverviewThis project implements a custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify kidney CT scans as either Cyst or Non-Cyst.Unlike standard student projects, this model was built with a rigorous "Train on Augmented, Test on Real" strategy. It leverages advanced medical-grade data augmentation (Elastic Deformations, Gaussian Noise, Affine Transformations) to learn robust features from a small initial dataset, ensuring high reliability on unseen patient data.🚀 Key FeaturesHigh Precision: Achieved 100% Accuracy on a separate, external test set of real patient images.Robust Training: Trained on 550+ augmented images generated from a base dataset using Albumentations.Medical-Grade Augmentation: Uses Elastic Transformations to mimic organic tissue deformation, preventing memorization.Full-Stack Deployment: Includes a user-friendly Web Interface built with Flask and Tailwind CSS.Confidence Metrics: The model provides a confidence percentage (e.g., "98.5% Sure"), not just a binary guess.🛠️ Tech StackDeep Learning: PyTorch (torch, torchvision)Image Processing: OpenCV, PIL, AlbumentationsBackend: Flask (Python)Frontend: HTML5, Tailwind CSS (Modern Blue/Medical Theme)Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn (Confusion Matrices, Learning Curves)🧠 Model ArchitectureThe core is a custom CNN architecture (KidneyCystCNN) designed specifically for $128 \times 128$ medical slices:Feature Extraction: 4 Convolutional blocks (32 $\rightarrow$ 64 $\rightarrow$ 128 $\rightarrow$ 256 filters) with ReLU and Max Pooling.Regularization: Optimized Dropout (0.25) to prevent overfitting while maintaining high confidence.Classification: Fully connected layers ending in a Sigmoid activation for binary probability.📊 Methodology & ResultsData StrategyTo solve the "Small Dataset" problem common in medical AI, I implemented an offline augmentation pipeline:Input: 50 High-Quality Original Scans.Augmentation: Generated 10 variations per image using Elastic Transform, Rotation, Gaussian Noise, and Brightness contrast.Total Training Data: 550+ Images.PerformanceTraining Loss: Converged to 0.02 (High Confidence).Validation Accuracy: 100.00% (Tested on a strictly separated folder of real images).
